# Binance Proxy

A fast and simple Websocket Proxy for the Binance API written in GoLang. Mimics the behavior of API endpoints to avoid rate limiting imposed on IP's when using REST queries. Intended Usage for multiple instances of applications querying the Binance API at a rate that might lead to banning or blocking, like for example the [Freqtrade Trading Bot](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade), or any other similar application. </p>

## ⚡ Quick Start

You can download the pre-compiled binary for the architecture of your choice from the [relaseses page](https://github.com/stash86/binance-proxy/releases) on GitHub.

Unzip the package to a folder of choice, preferably one that's in `$PATH`

```bash
tar -xf binance-proxy_1.0.2_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin 
```

Starting the proxy:

```bash
binance-proxy
```

That's all you need to know to start! 🎉

Once running, you can check the proxy status at:

- SPOT: `http://localhost:8090/status`  
- FUTURES: `http://localhost:8091/status`

And restart the service remotely at:

- SPOT: `http://localhost:8090/restart`
- FUTURES: `http://localhost:8091/restart`

### 🐳 Docker-way to quick start

If you don't want to install or compile the binance-proxy to your system, feel free using the prebuild  [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/stash86/binance-proxy) and run it from an isolated container:

```bash
docker run --rm -d stash86/binance-proxy:latest
```

ℹ️ Please pay attention to configuring network access, per default the ports `8090` and `8091` are exposed, if you specify different ports via parameters, you will need to re-configure your docker setup. Please refer to the [docker network documentation](https://docs.docker.com/network/), how to adjust this inside a container.

## ⚒️ Installing from source

First of all, [download](https://golang.org/dl/) and install **Go**. Version `1.17` or higher is required.

Installation is done by using the [`go install`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies) command and rename installed binary in `$GOPATH/bin`:

```bash
go install github.com/stash86/binance-proxy/cmd/binance-proxy
```

## 📖 Basic Usage

The proxy listens automatically on port **8090** for Spot markets, and port **8091** for Futures markets. Available options for parametrizations are available via `-h`

```

### 🪙 Example Usage with Freqtrade

**Freqtrade** needs to be aware, that the **API endpoint** for querying the exchange is not the public endpoint, which is usually `https://api.binance.com` but instead queries are being proxied. To achieve that, the appropriate `config.json` needs to be adjusted in the `{ exchange: { urls: { api: public: "..."} } }` section.

```json
{
    "exchange": {
        "name": "binance",
        "key": "",
        "secret": "",
        "ccxt_config": {
            "enableRateLimit": false,
            "urls": {
                "api": {
                    "public": "http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/v3"
                }
            }
        },
        "ccxt_async_config": {
            "enableRateLimit": false
        }
    }
}
```

This example assumes, that `binance-proxy` is running on the same host as the consuming application, thus `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` is used as the target address. Should `binance-proxy` run in a separate 🐳 **Docker** container, a separate instance or a k8s pod, the target address has to be replaced respectively, and it needs to be ensured that the required ports (8090/8091 per default) are opened for requests.

## ➡️ Supported API endpoints for caching

| Endpoint | Market | Purpose | Socket Update Interval | Comments |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------------------|----------|
| `/api/v3/klines`, `/fapi/v1/klines` | spot/futures | Kline/candlestick bars for a symbol | ~2s | Websocket is closed if there is no following request after `2 * interval_time` (e.g., a websocket for a symbol on `5m` timeframe is closed after 10 minutes).  Following requests for `klines` cannot be delivered from the websocket cache: - `limit` parameter is > 1000 - `startTime` or `endTime` have been specified |
| `/api/v3/depth`, `/fapi/v1/depth` | spot/futures | Order Book (Depth) | 100ms | Websocket is closed if there is no following request after 2 minutes.  The `depth` endpoint serves only a maximum depth of 20. |
| `/api/v3/ticker/24hr` | spot | 24hr ticker price change statistics | 2s/100ms (see comments) | Websocket is closed if there is no following request after 2 minutes.  For faster updates, the values for `lastPrice`, `bidPrice`, and `askPrice` are taken from the `bookTicker` which is updated in an interval of 100ms. |
| `/api/v3/exchangeInfo`, `/fapi/v1/exchangeInfo` | spot/futures | Current exchange trading rules and symbol information | 60s (see comments) | `exchangeInfo` is fetched periodically via REST every 60 seconds. It is not a websocket endpoint but just being cached during runtime. |

> 🚨 Every **other** REST query to an endpoint is being **forwarded** 1:1 to the **API** at <https://api.binance.com> !

## 📊 Status Endpoint

The proxy includes a built-in status endpoint to monitor the health and performance of the service:

### 🔍 Accessing the Status

- **SPOT markets**: `http://localhost:8090/status`
- **FUTURES markets**: `http://localhost:8091/status`

### 📈 Status Information

The status endpoint provides comprehensive information about the proxy service:

```json
{
  "proxy_status": {
    "service": "github.com/stash86/binance-proxy",
    "healthy": true,
    "start_time": "2025-06-15T10:30:00Z",
    "uptime": "2h15m30s",
    "requests": 1542,
    "errors": 3,
    "error_rate": 0.19,
    "last_error": "connection timeout",
    "last_error_at": "2025-06-15T12:42:15Z",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-15T12:45:30Z"
  },
  "class": "SPOT",
  "ban_info": {
    "banned": false,
    "recovery_time": null
  },
  "config": {
    "fake_kline_enabled": true,
    "always_show_forwards": false
  }
}
```

### 📋 Status Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `service` | Service name identifier |
| `healthy` | Overall health status (becomes false if error rate > 10%) |
| `start_time` | When the service was started |
| `uptime` | How long the service has been running |
| `requests` | Total number of requests processed |
| `errors` | Total number of errors encountered |
| `error_rate` | Percentage of requests that resulted in errors |
| `last_error` | Most recent error message (if any) |
| `last_error_at` | Timestamp of the most recent error |
| `banned` | Whether the API is currently banned by Binance |
| `recovery_time` | Expected recovery time if banned |

### 🔧 Usage Examples

```bash
# Check SPOT market status
curl http://localhost:8090/status

# Check FUTURES market status  
curl http://localhost:8091/status

# Monitor in a loop (Linux/Mac)
watch -n 5 "curl -s http://localhost:8090/status | jq"
```

## 🔄 Restart Endpoint

The proxy includes a restart endpoint for remote service management:

### 🚀 Accessing the Restart

- **SPOT markets**: `http://localhost:8090/restart`
- **FUTURES markets**: `http://localhost:8091/restart`

### ⚡ Restart Response

```json
{
  "message": "Restart initiated",
  "status": "success",
  "class": "SPOT",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-15T12:45:30Z",
  "warning": "Service will restart in 2 seconds. This will interrupt all active connections."
}
```

### 🔧 How It Works

1. **Immediate response** sent to confirm restart initiation
2. **2-second delay** to ensure response is delivered
3. **Graceful shutdown** of the current process
4. **Automatic restart** (requires process manager or Docker restart policy)

### 🐳 Docker Setup for Automatic Restart

#### **Basic Setup (Recommended)**

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  binance-proxy:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8090:8090"
      - "8091:8091"
    restart: unless-stopped  # Enables automatic restart on crash/manual restart
```

#### **Advanced Setup with Health Monitoring**

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  binance-proxy:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8090:8090"
      - "8091:8091"
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8090/status"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
```

#### **Complete Setup with Auto-Heal (Restart on Health Failure)**

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  binance-proxy:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8090:8090"
      - "8091:8091"
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8090/status"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
    labels:
      - "autoheal=true"

  autoheal:
    image: willfarrell/autoheal:latest
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      - AUTOHEAL_CONTAINER_LABEL=autoheal
      - AUTOHEAL_INTERVAL=5
```

#### **Restart Policy Options**

| Policy | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `no` | Never restart (default) | Development/testing |
| `always` | Always restart | Critical services |
| `unless-stopped` | Restart unless manually stopped | **Recommended for production** |
| `on-failure` | Restart only on non-zero exit | Services that shouldn't restart on normal stop |

### 🖥️ Non-Docker Automatic Restart Setup

#### **Linux - Systemd (Recommended)**

Create a systemd service file:

```bash
# Create service file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/binance-proxy.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Binance Proxy Service
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
User=binance-proxy
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/binance-proxy
WorkingDirectory=/opt/binance-proxy
Environment=BPX_VERBOSE=true

# Health check and restart on failure
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
TimeoutStopSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
# Enable and start service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable binance-proxy
sudo systemctl start binance-proxy

# Check status
sudo systemctl status binance-proxy
```

#### **Windows - NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager)**

```powershell
# Download and install NSSM
# https://nssm.cc/download

# Install as Windows service
nssm install BinanceProxy "C:\Path\To\binance-proxy.exe"
nssm set BinanceProxy AppDirectory "C:\Path\To"
nssm set BinanceProxy DisplayName "Binance Proxy Service"
nssm set BinanceProxy Description "Binance API Proxy with automatic restart"

# Configure automatic restart
nssm set BinanceProxy AppExit Default Restart
nssm set BinanceProxy AppRestartDelay 5000

# Start service
nssm start BinanceProxy
```

#### **Linux - Supervisor**

```bash
# Install supervisor
sudo apt-get install supervisor

# Create config file
sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/binance-proxy.conf
```

```ini
[program:binance-proxy]
command=/usr/local/bin/binance-proxy
directory=/opt/binance-proxy
user=binance-proxy
autostart=true
autorestart=true
startretries=3
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/var/log/binance-proxy.log
environment=BPX_VERBOSE=true
```

```bash
# Update supervisor and start
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update
sudo supervisorctl start binance-proxy
```

#### **macOS - LaunchDaemon**

```bash
# Create launchd plist
sudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.binance.proxy.plist
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.binance.proxy</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/local/bin/binance-proxy</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/var/log/binance-proxy.log</string>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/var/log/binance-proxy.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

```bash
# Load and start service
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.binance.proxy.plist
sudo launchctl start com.binance.proxy
```

#### **Process Manager Comparison**

| Method | Platform | Complexity | Features | Production Ready |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|------------------|
| **Systemd** | Linux | Medium | ✅ Logs, ✅ Health checks, ✅ Auto-restart | ✅ Excellent |
| **NSSM** | Windows | Easy | ✅ GUI config, ✅ Auto-restart | ✅ Good |
| **Supervisor** | Linux | Easy | ✅ Web UI, ✅ Process groups | ✅ Good |
| **LaunchDaemon** | macOS | Medium | ✅ System integration | ✅ Good |

#### **Manual Script Alternative (Basic)**

For development or simple setups:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# restart-loop.sh
while true; do
    echo "Starting binance-proxy..."
    ./binance-proxy
    echo "Process exited with code $?. Restarting in 5 seconds..."
    sleep 5
done
```

```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x restart-loop.sh
nohup ./restart-loop.sh > proxy.log 2>&1 &
```

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Security**: No authentication required - restrict network access in production
- **Scope**: Restarting either port restarts the entire service (both SPOT and FUTURES)
- **Downtime**: Expect 10-15 seconds total restart time
- **Fresh State**: Complete reset of connections, caches, and statistics

### 🔧 Restart Usage Examples

```bash
# Restart from command line
curl http://localhost:8090/restart

# Or simply visit in browser:
# http://localhost:8090/restart
```

## ⚙️ Commands & Options

The following parameters are available to control the behavior of **binance-proxy**:

```bash
